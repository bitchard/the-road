And it begins...here is the header for site along with the ballon which will come into play later.

view of the background image being added. now for some strange reason only some parts of my style.css is working and I have gone over it with a fine tooth comb and still cant figure out why. So i'm still moving forward without knowing whats going on but I'm hoping once I stop trying to figure it out the answer will come to me.

Ok so I believe part of the learning process is mistakes or errors you cant find until you walk away or in this case start all over and try it from a diffrent approach. so in last step I didnt know why my style.css wasnt working with my html. Finally i just threw it all out and started over. But this time I started with my navbar instead of my header. And for some strange reason the box shadow i added worked. I never did on first website and thats when i knew something was wrong but continued anyway but then more other parts werent working also. some but not all so thats where i was lost of how and why. So here are the screeen shots of that process.
