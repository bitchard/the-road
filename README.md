First screenshot to check that my website was going to be connected correctly.

And it begins...here is the header for site along with the ballon which will come into play later.

view of the background image being added. now for some strange reason only some parts of my style.css is working and I have gone over it with a fine tooth comb and still cant figure out why. So i'm still moving forward without knowing whats going on but I'm hoping once I stop trying to figure it out the answer will come to me.

Ok so I believe part of the learning process is mistakes or errors you cant find until you walk away or in this case start all over and try it from a diffrent approach. so in last step I didnt know why my style.css wasnt working with my html. Finally i just threw it all out and started over. But this time I started with my navbar instead of my header. And for some strange reason the box shadow i added worked. I never did on first website and thats when i knew something was wrong but continued anyway but then more other parts werent working also. some but not all so thats where i was lost of how and why. So here are the screeen shots of that process.
Doing the Navbar first instead of header

As you can see now my box shadow is working and on other site i couldnt get it to work from the start. Ive compared code over and over and I cant see how or why one works and one does not. Its so odd.

Same thing here Ive gone back and did find one mistake I had left the closing div above the where it should have been so style could never work because i closed it out. but my text also is suppose to be way smaller and ba;llon should be in the middle with the text on each side of it much smaller. And I still cant find my mistake there. but i dont quit so i will keep searching.
